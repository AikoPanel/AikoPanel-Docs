## Plan capacity:
A plan capacity is a measure of the amount of data a customer can use in a particular plan, typically for internet or mobile plans. This capacity is usually measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB).

## Device Limit:
A device limit is a policy or service that sets a maximum number of devices that a customer can connect to and use at the same time with that policy or service. This policy is intended to manage network resource usage and ensure service quality.

# Apple ID Request Limit:
A Apple ID Request Limit is a policy set by Apple on the number of times a user can create or use an Apple ID on different devices or accounts within a given period of time. This policy is intended to prevent abuse and protect user accounts.

These limits may include:

1. Number of new Apple IDs: Apple may limit the number of times a user can create a new Apple ID in a day or a week.

2. Number of associated devices: Apple has a limit on the number of devices that can be signed in to the same Apple ID within a period of time. Typically, an Apple ID can be used on up to 10 devices, of which up to 5 can be computers.

3. Number of times an Apple ID can be signed in: Apple may also limit the number of times the same Apple ID can be signed in on multiple devices within a short period of time to prevent unauthorized account sharing.

These limits help Apple maintain the security and privacy of its users, and prevent fraud or abuse of the system.

## Server Group:
A server group is a collection of servers configured to work together to achieve a specific goal. Servers in the group can share load, data, or functions to provide services more efficiently and ensure high availability. Server groups are often used in systems with high requirements for performance, reliability, and scalability.

There are several common types of server groups, including:

1. Load Balancing Group: Distributes workloads across multiple servers to optimize resources and ensure that no server is overloaded.

2. Failover Group: Ensures high availability by automatically switching services to a backup server if the primary server fails.

3. Storage Group: Groups storage servers together to provide larger storage capacity and improve data retrieval speed.

4. Compute Group: Combines compute servers to perform complex tasks or process large amounts of data more efficiently.

Server groups improve the performance, flexibility, and reliability of systems and services, and make management easier in complex IT environments.

## Data Reset Method:
Data reset method is the process or method used by the service provider to reset the used data traffic to the original level in a particular cycle. This is usually applied to mobile data or internet plans that have monthly traffic limits. Once the traffic is reset, the customer can start using it again for the new cycle.

Common traffic reset methods include:

1. Monthly reset: The traffic usage is reset at the beginning of each month, allowing the customer to have full traffic to use in the new month.

2. Weekly or daily reset: Less commonly used, some plans may reset the traffic weekly or daily.

3. Manual reset: Some services allow customers to reset the traffic themselves by purchasing additional packages or using the feature in the provider's application.
4. Automatic reset when upgrading a plan: When customers upgrade to a higher plan, the traffic can be reset immediately so that they can take advantage of the higher capacity of the new plan.

Traffic reset helps customers manage their data usage more effectively and avoid overage charges due to using more than the plan limit.

## Maximum number of buyers:
The maximum number of buyers is the maximum limit on the number of people who can participate in purchasing a certain product, service, or plan. This limit can be applied in different situations, such as:

1. Promotions: To control the number of participants and ensure fairness, the provider can limit the maximum number of buyers who can participate in the promotion.
2. Special sales events: During limited-time or limited-quantity sales events, such as Black Friday, providers may limit the maximum number of buyers to avoid system overload and ensure a good shopping experience for all customers.
3. Special service packages: Some service packages may limit the number of subscribers to ensure service quality or for limited resource reasons.

Limiting the maximum number of buyers helps providers manage resources, control demand, and ensure the best service quality for customers.

## Package SNI:
The package SNI (Server Name Indication) is an extension of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol that allows a client to specify the domain name (hostname) it wants to connect to during the SSL/TLS handshake. This is especially useful when a server uses multiple virtual hosts and needs to serve different SSL certificates based on the domain name requested by the client.

Specifically:

1. Purpose of SNI: Helps the server distinguish between different domain names and provide the appropriate SSL certificate. This is important when multiple domains are hosted on the same IP address.

2. How SNI works: When a client initiates a TLS connection with a server, it sends the domain name it wants to connect to during the SSL/TLS handshake. The server uses this information to select the appropriate SSL certificate for that domain.

3. Application of SNI: Common in web hosting services, where multiple websites are hosted on the same server. SNI allows each website to have its own SSL certificate without the need for a separate IP address.

SNI helps optimize server resource usage and improve security for online services by ensuring that each domain can use its own SSL certificate.

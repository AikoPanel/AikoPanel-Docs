# System Setup
## [Website]
## Name website:
-A web name is the name of a website or domain name that a user enters into a browser to access that website. A web name often reflects the brand, content, or purpose of the website and plays an important role in identifying and identifying the website in cyberspace.

## The web name consists of two main parts:

1. Domain Name: The actual name of the website, such as "example" in "example.com".
2. Top-Level Domain (TLD) Extension: The end of the domain name, such as ".com", ".org", ".net", ".edu", ".gov", etc.

Example:
- "google.com": "Google" is the domain name and ".com" is the extension.
- "wikipedia.org": "wikipedia" is the domain name and ".org" is the extension.

-The web name should be easy to remember, easy to spell, and often related to the content or purpose of the website so that users can easily identify and access it.
## Website Description:
A website description is a brief paragraph or series of sentences intended to provide an overview of the website's content, purpose, and functionality. This description usually appears on the homepage, in the site's meta description tag, or in search engine results listings such as Google.

## An effective website description usually includes the following elements:

1. Name and type of service/product: Introduce the name of the website and main field of operation.
2. Purpose: Explain the purpose of the website, e.g. providing information, online sales, sharing news, etc.
3. Target audience: Clearly state the target audience or main users of the website.
4. Key Features: A brief description of what outstanding features or key services the website offers.
5. Benefits: Clarify why users should visit and use this website.

For example, "Our website offers online courses on programming for all levels. With professional faculty and constantly updated content, we are committed to providing students with the best learning experience. Join today to advance your skills and career!"
## Website Address:
A website address, or URL (Uniform Resource Locator), is a path that a user enters into a web browser to access a specific website. The website address consists of the following components:

1. Protocol: Defines the method of connection and data transmission. The most common are HTTP ('http://') and HTTPS ('https://'), where HTTPS is the more secure version of HTTP.
2. Domain Name: The unique address of a website on the internet, such as "example.com".
3. Path: Specify the specific location of the page or file on the website, such as "/about" or "/products".
4. Query Parameters: Provides additional information for a specific query, usually starting with a question mark "?" and followed by key-value pairs, e.g., "?id=123&sort=asc".

Website address is the way that users and browsers identify and access pages and resources on the internet.
## SubDomain Address (If applicable) - (No http:// or https://):
-A SubDomain address is an extension of the main domain name and is used to organize and divide the content on a website. Subdomains precede the main domain name and are often used to create separate parts of a website that still belong to the same domain.

The structure of a SubDomain address is usually as follows:
"subdomain.domain.com"

## In which:
- *subdomain*: The name of the SubDomain, which can be any valid string of characters.
- *domain*: The primary domain name of the website.
- *.com*: An extension of the domain name.

Example:
- "blog.example.com": "blog" is a SubDomain.
- "shop.example.com": "shop" là SubDomain.
- "support.example.com": "support" là SubDomain.

-Subdomains help to divide and manage content more efficiently, especially for websites that are large or have a variety of services and functions.
## Subscription URL:
-A subscription URL is a web address that leads to a page or section of a website where a user can sign up for a service, product, or content. This URL usually contains information about the different subscription plans, pricing, and benefits that users will receive when they sign up.

-Subscription URL makes it easy for users to find and subscribe to the services or products that the website offers.
## Require the website or URL to use HTTPS:
-Require the website or URL to use HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) to ensure that the data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server is encrypted and secure. The use of HTTPS offers many benefits, including:

1. Data Security: HTTPS encrypts data, protecting sensitive information such as passwords, credit card information, and personal data from being intercepted and stolen by hackers.
2. Authentication: HTTPS helps verify that users are connecting to an official website, minimizing the risk of phishing attacks and other types of attacks.
3. Data integrity: HTTPS ensures that data is not altered or tampered with in transit.
4. Increased credibility: Modern browsers often display a lock icon next to the URL when the website uses HTTPS, which increases user trust in the website.

## To require a website or URL to use HTTPS, you can:
- Install an SSL/TLS certificate: Make sure that your website has a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
- Web Server Configuration: Configure the web server to automatically redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS. This can be done by modifying the server's configuration file, such as '.htaccess' on Apache or 'nginx.conf' on Nginx.
- Use security policies: Set up HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to require browsers to use HTTPS only when accessing your website.

-Using HTTPS is a basic and important security standard for any website, especially those that handle sensitive information.
## LOGO
-A logo is a special graphic or design symbol used to represent a company, organization, product, brand, or service. Logos typically include a brand name, symbol, image, or a combination of these elements, and are designed to be easily recognizable and memorable.

The main characteristics of the logo include:

1. Simple and recognizable: Logos are often designed in such a way that they are easy to identify and remember.
2. Unique: The logo needs to be different and not confusing with the logos of other brands.
3. Brand Reflection: The logo should reflect the personality, values, and message that the brand wants to convey.
4. Versatile: Logos should be easy to use on a variety of platforms and sizes, from business cards, websites to large billboards.

-An effective logo helps create a strong impression and helps build brand identity in the minds of customers.
## Background URL:
-Background URL is a property in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that is used to set the background image for an HTML element. This property allows you to specify the path to an image file that you want to use as a background.

## URL Path

- Relative Path: The path is based on the location of the CSS file. For example, if the CSS file is in the 'css' folder and the image is in the 'images' folder, the path will be 'url('.. /images/background.jpg')'.
- Absolute path: The full path includes the domain name. For example, 'url('https://example.com/images/background.jpg')'.

Using "background-image" with a URL makes it easy to add a background image to your website and customize the look and feel flexibly.
##  Custom HTML for footer:
-Custom HTML for footer is the HTML code used to create a footer for a website. The footer usually contains contact information, copyright, links to important pages, and other information that you want to display at the bottom of the page.

-You can further customize the HTML and CSS to suit the needs and design style of your website.
## User Terms of Use URL:
-A user's Terms of Service (TOS) URL is a web address that leads to a page or document that contains the terms and conditions that a user must comply with when using a website's services or products. This site generally includes provisions on the rights and obligations of users, the rights and responsibilities of service providers, and rules on information security and privacy.

-The terms of use URL is usually linked from the footer or main menu of the website so that users can easily find and read it before using the service. This helps to ensure that the user understands the conditions and regulations associated with the use of the website or services.
## Stop registering new users:
-Deregistration of new users is when a website or service temporarily or permanently stops accepting registrations from new users. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including:

1.  System maintenance and upgrades: The website or service may need time to maintain, upgrade, or improve the system and want to ensure that there are no new users registering during this time.
2. System Overload: When the system or service reaches its capacity limit, the provider may suspend new subscriptions to maintain the quality of service for existing users.
3. Policy Changes: The Site may be changing its terms of service, privacy policy, or structure of the service, and wish to discontinue new registrations during this adjustment period.
4. Fight against fraud or abuse: If the website detects fraud or abuse related to registering a new account, they may temporarily stop the registration to deal with the problem.
5. Redirecting or closing the service: When a website or service redirects its business or decides to shut down, it may stop accepting new users.

-When discontinuing the registration of a new user, the website will usually clearly inform the user of this decision and, if possible, provide the reason and expected time for the discontinuation.

-This notification helps current and potential users understand the situation and know when they can expect to register again or how to contact for more information.
## Free Trial:
-A free trial is a period of time that allows users to access and use a product or service without having to pay for it. Free trials are often offered by software companies, online services, and other providers as a way for potential users to experience the features and benefits of a product before deciding to purchase or sign up for a service.

##Các Key features of free testing include:

1. Limited time: Free trials usually have a time limit, ranging from a few days to a few weeks. For example, a service may offer a free trial period that lasts 7 days, 14 days, or even 30 days.
2. Full or Limited Access: In some cases, users may have full access to all the features of the product or service. In other cases, only certain features are unlocked for users to test.
3. No Credit Card Required: Some services require users to provide credit card information when signing up for a free trial, while others do not.
4. Auto-renewal: If the user does not cancel the subscription before the end of the free trial period, some services will automatically switch to a paid plan and start charging.

-Free trials are an effective way for companies to attract new users and allow them to experience a product or service before committing to a fee. This helps build trust and increase the likelihood of converting test users into paying customers.
## Test time (hours):
-Testing period (hours) is the period of time that is measured in hours that a user can use a product or service for free before having to decide to purchase or subscribe to that service. During this stage, users can experience the features and benefits of the product or service to assess whether it is suitable for their needs.

The duration of the test can be specified by the number of hours. For example, a software service may offer new users a testing period of 24 hours, 48 hours, or 72 hours.

## The main characteristics of the test time (hours) include:

1. Specific time limit: The test time is clearly defined by the number of hours, e.g. 24 hours, 48 hours, or 72 hours.
2. Full or Limited Access: During this period, users may have full or limited access to the features of the product or service.
3. Non-binding: Users are not bound to purchase or subscribe to the service after the trial period expires, but they will need to decide if they want to continue using the service.
4. Automatic Stop Access: When the test period ends, users may be discontinued from accessing the service or product until they sign up or purchase the service.

-The testing period (hours) is an effective way for users to quickly experience and evaluate a product or service, which is especially useful for online services and software that users need to try before making a purchase decision.

# [Subweb]
## CTV website address (no http:// or https://)
- CTV (Collaborative Television) website address is the URL of the website that does not include the prefix "http://" or "https://". This address is often used to access the website directly.

-A website address without a prefix will only contain the domain name part of the URL. This is the spelling that is often used in documents or in cases where it is not necessary to specify the access protocol.
## Employee account creation limits: 
-Employee account creation limits are regulations and restrictions that are set to control the creation of new accounts for employees in a system or service. These limits may include the number of accounts an employee can create, account permissions, or authentication requirements when creating a new account. These limits help ensure security, manage resources effectively, and prevent system abuse.

## Common factors in employee account creation limits:

1. Maximum number of accounts: Limit the number of accounts an employee can create in a specific period of time (e.g., a day, a week).
2. Powers and Roles: Define different permissions and roles for new staff accounts, e.g., management accounts, regular staff accounts, support accounts, etc.
3. Authentication Requirements: Set authentication requirements such as company emails, verification codes, or confirmations from management before creating a new account.
4. Access restrictions: Restrict access to sensitive features or data based on the account's role.
5.  Account creation time: Set a limit on the time of day or week when a new account can be created.
6. Approval Process: New account requirements must be approved by management or an authorized person before activation.

-Setting limits on employee account creation helps protect the system, prevent abuse, and ensure that account management takes place in an organized and secure manner.
## Display Name Sever to create a website for employees:
-Displaying name servers for creating a website for employees means providing information about the name servers needed to configure and manage the domain name of the website. Name servers are servers that are responsible for translating domain names into corresponding IP addresses, allowing web browsers to access the correct website.

## Why do I need to display the name server?

1.  Domain name configuration: When an employee needs to set up a new website, they will need to know the name servers to update their domain name settings.
2. DNS Management: A name server helps manage DNS (Domain Name System) records, including A (address), CNAME (primary name), MX (mail exchange), and other records necessary for website operations.
3. Ensure proper access: Make sure that when a user enters a domain name into a browser, they will be redirected to the correct IP address of the website host.

## How to update the name server:

1. Access to domain management: Log in to your domain management account at your domain provider.
2. Find the DNS management or name server section: Find the DNS management or name server section in the control panel.
3. Update name servers: Enter the name servers that have been provided (e.g., 'ns1.exampledns.com', 'ns2.exampledns.com',...) in the corresponding fields.
4. Save changes: Save changes and wait for a period of time for the DNS to update (usually a few hours to 48 hours).

Name server information is an important part of setting up and managing a website, ensuring that your domain name is properly connected to the website host.
## Name Sliver Information:
Name servers (also known as domain name server information) are special servers that are configured to handle requests related to domain names. The main function of a name server is to translate domain names into corresponding IP addresses so that web browsers can access websites.

## The main information of a name server includes:

1. Name of the server: This is the identifier of the server, e.g. 'ns1.example.com'.
2. IP address of the name server: This IP address is where the name server is actually located and to which DNS requests will be sent.
3. Name server type: There are two main types: primary name server and secondary name server, with the primary usually being primarily responsible for managing the domain name.

## Role of name server:

- Domain name resolution: The name server is responsible for translating domain names such as example.com into IP addresses such as 192.0.2.1.
- DNS record management: In addition to resolving domain names, name servers also store and manage DNS records such as A, MX, CNAME, TXT, etc. to determine how to handle requests related to domain names.

## Managing and configuring name servers:

- Domain name registration: When registering a new domain name, users need to provide name server information to specify where the domain name is managed.
- DNS Configuration and Processing: In the domain management dashboard, users can change the configuration and management of name servers and other DNS records.

Name server information is an important part of the Internet infrastructure, ensuring that all requests to the domain name are resolved to the correct IP address of the respective website host.
## Employee Web Communication:
The term "employee web communication" is not a common technical term in the field of information technology and web development. However, you may be wondering about the concept that involves interacting and communicating between websites or systems that employees use. Here are some of the terminology possibilities you might be interested in:

1. Integrations: This is the process of combining functions or data from different systems into a single system that works more efficiently. For example, integration between a website and a payment system to process online transactions.
2. Interoperability: This is the ability of systems or software to work together and share data effectively, especially when they are sourced from different vendors. For example, compatibility between web applications to share information between departments in the business.
3. Web Services: These are standard methods for exchanging data between different applications on the Internet. Web services allow applications to use protocols such as HTTP to access and exchange data.

-If there is more specific information or a need for more clarity on the concept you want to learn, please provide more details so that I can better assist you.
# [Statistics]
## Order and Revenue Statistics Per Day:
Order and revenue statistics per day is the process of collecting and analyzing data to see the number of orders and total revenue that a business or website has achieved in each particular day. This is an important activity to monitor business performance and make strategic decisions based on this statistical data.

## Information is usually included in the daily order and turnover statistics:

1. Number of orders: This is the number of orders or transactions that the system has processed in each day. Orders can include items of sale, services, or other transactions depending on the type of business of the business.
2. Total revenue: This is the total amount of money collected from orders in each day. Revenue can be calculated from the value of the sale minus the costs incurred such as discounts, taxes, shipping charges, etc.
3. Charts and reports: This information is often represented in the form of charts or statistical reports for easy observation and analysis of business trends over time.
4. Further analysis: In addition to key metrics such as the number of orders and revenue, it is also possible to further analyze metrics such as average order value, order conversion rate, and compare to previous cycles or times to evaluate business performance.

- Daily order and revenue statistics are a useful tool for businesses to evaluate performance and make adjustments to optimize business and revenue growth.
## Today's Node Traffic Statistics:
-To statistics the traffic of a Node.js server today, you can use popular tools and libraries in Node.js such as 'express', 'morgan', or extension solutions such as 'pm2' to manage and collect data.

## Use 'express' and 'morgan' for traffic statistics:

1. Install 'express' and 'morgan':
   '''bash
   npm install express morgan
   ```
2.  Configure 'morgan' in Node.js app:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const morgan = require('morgan');
   const app = express();

   Use morgan to log to the console
   app.use(morgan('combined'));
   Define other routes and middleware
   // ...
   Starting the server
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   app.listen(port, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```
   When you start the server, 'morgan' logs into the console of each request received, including information such as the client's IP address, request path, status code, and response time.
3. View traffic information: You can track the number of requests in each day by analyzing the logs recorded by morgan.

-To do this more efficiently and track traffic day by day, it may be necessary to use more powerful log management tools and solutions such as 'pm2' or online log management services such as Papertrail and Loggly, to analyze and track traffic information and related statistics.

-Perpetual invitation codes that do not expire are a powerful tool for building and maintaining long-term relationships with users and partners, ensuring continuous and easy access without having to worry about time limits.
## Commissions are only activated for the first time:
"Commission is activated only for the first time" is a mechanism in commission or affiliate programs where the commission is calculated and paid only for the first transaction of a newly referred client through a partner or affiliate's affiliate or invitation code. After the first trade, the subsequent trades of that client will not generate a commission for the referrer.

## Key features of this mechanism:

1. First-time application only: The commission is paid for the first trade or registration that a new client makes after being referred.
2. Encourage new referrals: This mechanism motivates partners and agencies to focus on finding and referring new customers instead of relying solely on an existing group of customers.
3. Easy to manage: Paying only the commission for the first trade makes it easy for the system to track and manage commission payments.
4. Reduce commission costs: Capping commissions on the first transaction helps reduce the total commission cost payable, creating conditions for businesses to maintain better profits.

## Benefits of this mechanism:

- Encourage customer network development: Partners and agents are encouraged to find more new customers to receive commissions, helping businesses expand their customer base.
- Focus on quality: Since commissions are only paid for the first time, partners tend to focus on finding and referring quality customers who are likely to use the service for a long time.
- Cost control: Helps businesses control commission costs more effectively, only paying for truly new contributions.

## Limitations:

- Less motivation to retain customers: Partners may have less motivation to maintain relationships with customers after the first transaction, as they do not receive commissions for subsequent transactions.
- High competition: Competition between partners to refer new customers can be very high, especially in industries with multiple agencies or affiliate programs.

-In summary, "first-time activated commission" is a commission payment method that aims to encourage new customer referrals and control commission costs for businesses.
## Auto Confirmation Commission:
"Automatically confirmed commission" is a mechanism in commission or affiliate programs where the commission is calculated and confirmed automatically after a specific transaction or action is completed. This means that there is no need for manual intervention from the admin or system to approve commissions; Instead, this process is done automatically based on pre-set conditions.

## Key features of auto-confirmed commissions:

1.  Process automation: Commissions are calculated and confirmed automatically by the system when conditions have been met, such as when a purchase is completed or when a new customer signs up for a service.
2. Time-saving: Reduces the need for manual operations, saving time for both program managers and partners/agencies.
3. Transparency and accuracy: Automation systems help ensure transparency and accuracy in calculating and confirming commissions, minimizing the risk of human error.
4. Improved partner experience: Partners or affiliates can receive commissions faster and easier, improving their experience with the commission program.

## Benefits of auto-confirmed commissions:

- Increased Efficiency: Process automation increases the operational efficiency of the system, allowing for more transactions and commissions to be processed without increasing manual workloads.
- Guaranteed timeliness: Commissions are confirmed and paid in a timely manner, making it possible for partners and agents to quickly receive income from the trades they have made.
- Reduced administrative costs: Automation reduces the costs associated with managing and processing manual commission confirmation requests.

## How it works:

1. Set up confirmation conditions: The system will have clear conditions about what is required for the commission to be confirmed, such as completing an order, successfully registering, or achieving a certain goal.
2. Tracking and recording transactions: The system tracks and records transactions or actions that meet the conditions for confirmation.
3. Automatic confirmation and notification: When conditions are met, the system will automatically confirm the commission and notify the partner/agent of the amount of commission they have received.

-Automated commission confirmations are an important part of automating and optimizing commission programs, helping to increase the efficiency and satisfaction of participating partners and agents.
## Minimum Commission:
- "Minimum commission" is the minimum amount that a partner or affiliate needs to achieve before a commission can be requested or paid. This is a certain threshold set by the service provider or affiliate system to ensure that the commission payments are not too small, which minimizes transaction and management costs.

### Main features of minimum commission:

1. Payout threshold: The minimum commission sets a threshold that a partner or agency must reach before they can request payment. For example, if the minimum commission threshold is $50, the partner must accumulate at least $50 before they can receive the funds.
2. Efficient management: Help the system manage commission payments more efficiently by reducing the number of small transactions, thus, reducing administrative costs and transaction fees.
3. Encourage activity: Partners or agencies are motivated to increase marketing and sales activities in order to achieve a minimum commission threshold.

## Benefits of minimal commission:

- Reduced transaction costs: Paying for many small transactions can be costly due to bank transaction fees or payment processing fees. By setting a minimum commission, the service provider can reduce this cost.
- Increase management efficiency: Reduce the workload associated with processing and managing multiple small payments, making the system more efficient.
- Value Assurance: Ensure that commission payments are large enough in value to be worth managing and handling.

## Limitations:

- Delayed payments: Partners or affiliates may have to wait longer to reach the minimum commission threshold and receive payments, which can affect their cash flow.
- Creates pressure: Can create pressure on small or beginner partners who may have difficulty reaching the minimum threshold in a short period of time.

## Example:

If an affiliate system has a minimum commission threshold of $100, it means that a partner must accumulate at least $100 from commission trades before they can request or receive payments from the system. If they only reach $90, they will have to continue to generate an additional $10 from other trades to reach the threshold and receive a payout.

-Minimum commission is an important management tool in commission and affiliate programs, helping to maintain operational efficiency and ensure reasonable management costs.

## Three-tier proportional distribution:
"Three-tier proportional distribution" is often used in commission or profit distribution systems in affiliate marketing programs or multi-level marketing networks (MLMs). This system splits commissions or profits among members at three different levels in the network, based on a predetermined percentage.

## The main characteristics of three-tier scale distribution:

1. Level 1 (Direct Level): This is the direct level of the referrer. These are the people that a member directly invites to join or sell to them.
2. Level 2 (Second Level): Those who are invited by Level 1 to participate in or sell to them.
3. Level 3 (Third Level): Those who are invited by level 2 to participate in or sell to them.

## Benefits of Three-Tier Proportional Distribution:

1. Encourage network expansion: Encourage members to actively introduce and recruit more participants, expand the sales network.
2. Boost motivation: Provide motivation for members not only from their own sales activities but also from the activities of their subordinate members.
3. Ensure long-term benefits: Create a long-term source of passive income for members at higher levels.

## Limitations:

1. Complex in management: Managing a three-tier commission distribution system can be complex and requires a system of accurate monitoring and management.
2. Risk of fraud: If not strictly controlled, this system can be abused for fraudulent activities or Ponzi schemes.

## Border Style:
-Border styles are formatting properties that are applied to borders that surround elements in a document, such as web pages, text documents, tables, etc. In web design, border styles are often used in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to create different border effects for HTML elements.

## Common border styles in CSS:

1. Solid: Continuous border, no gaps between parts.
2. Dotted: Dotted dotted border, evenly spaced small dots.
3. dashed: Dashed strokes, evenly spaced strokes.
4. Double: Double border, consisting of two parallel lines with a gap between them.
5. Groove: The engraved edge is sunken, creating a 3D effect that makes the edge look like it is carved inward.
6. Ridge: The edging floats, creating a 3D effect that makes the edging look like it is floating on the surface.
7. Inset: Recessed bezel, making the element look like it is pressed down.
8. Outset: Embossed edging, making the element look like floating.
9. None: No borders.
10. hidden: Hidden border, similar to "none" but used to hide the border of the table.
## Header Style:
"Heading style" generally refers to the formatting and style applied to headings in a document, article, website, or any content with a hierarchical structure. In HTML and CSS, heading styles can be defined using heading tags and CSS rules to adjust their appearance.

### Why title styles matter:

1. Content structure: Helps readers and search engines understand the structure and hierarchy of information in the document.
2. User Experience: Make the document easier to read by dividing the content into clear sections.
3. SEO: Search engines use title tags to identify important content and rank websites.

-Using title tags and applying title styles in a reasonable way makes your document or website clearer, easier to read, and more professional.
## Theme color
Theme color is the primary color used to create a unified look and brand identity for a website, app, or any digital product. Theme colors are often used in important elements of the user interface such as headers, buttons, links, backgrounds, and other prominent elements.

## The importance of theme colors:

## API Connection Key:
An API key is a unique identifier provided to a user or application to access an API (Application Programming Interface). This key is typically used to control and monitor how the API is used, ensuring that only authorized applications or users can access the API's resources.

Why API connection keys are important:

1. Security: API keys help protect APIs from unauthorized access by authenticating users or applications.
2.Tracking and control: API providers can track API usage, log requests, and control traffic.
3.Quota management: API keys allow for quota management, ensuring that a user or application does not use too many API resources.

##  How to use API key:

The API key is usually sent along with the HTTP request to the API. There are many ways to send an API key, but the most common is through an HTTP header or as a parameter in a URL.

## How to create and manage API keys:

1. Register and get an API key: Usually, you need to register an account with an API provider and get an API key.
2. Secure storage: API keys should be stored securely and not shared publicly to avoid abuse.
3. Restrict access: Set up API key-based access restriction policies, such as limiting the number of requests, access time, and allowed actions.
4.Tracking and management: Track the use of API keys to detect and prevent unusual or unauthorized activities.

-API connection keys are an important tool in protecting and managing access to API services, ensuring the security and operational efficiency of the system.
## Button action continuous query interval:
-Debounce interval is a technique in programming to reduce the number of events that are processed when a continuous action occurs in a short period of time. This is often applied in cases such as button event handling, page scrolling, typing in search boxes, and many other similar scenarios.

### Why use debounce intervals:

1. Reduce system load: Prevent sending too many requests continuously to the server or performing too many resource-intensive operations.
2. Better User Experience: Ensure that operations are not interrupted by excessive event handling.
3. Performance: Improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of events that need to be processed.

## How the Debounce technique works:

Debounce ensures that a function is only executed after a certain amount of time since the event's last trigger. If the event is retriggered before this period ends, the clock will be reset, and the function will not be executed until the period ends with no new events.

## When to use Debounce:

- Handle input in search cells: To avoid sending too many search requests to the server.
- Handle page scrolling events: To avoid repeated function calls when the user scrolls the page.
- Window resizing event handling: To avoid performing resource-intensive operations when the window resizes continuously.

-The debounce technique is a powerful tool that improves performance and user experience in a variety of web and mobile applications.
## Continuous query interval of button sending action:
-The debounce interval for button submit actions is the amount of time it takes to wait before a button submit action is performed again. This technique helps prevent sending too many requests continuously when the user presses the button multiple times in a short period of time.

## Why use continuous query intervals for button submission actions:

1. Prevent multiple submissions: Avoid sending data repeatedly to the server when users accidentally press the send button repeatedly.
2. Improved performance: Reduce the load on the server by limiting the number of requests sent in a short period of time.
3. Avoid Unwanted Errors: Prevent problems such as creating multiple unnecessary records in the database or performing repetitive actions.

## How the Debounce technique works:

Debounce ensures that an action is only taken after a certain amount of time since the last button press. If the button is pressed again before this period ends, the clock will be reset and the action will not be performed until the period has ended without any new button presses.

## When to use Debounce for button submission actions:

- Submit Form: When you want to make sure that the data is only sent once when the user presses the submit button.
-  Server interaction: When you need to send requests to the server and want to avoid sending multiple requests in a row.
- Resource-Intensive Operations: When you need to perform resource-intensive operations and want to make sure that they are only performed once in a certain period of time.
##  The button's online data erasure period has expired:
-The Time to Live deletion period of the expired button (TTL) is a period of time after the online data becomes invalid or has expired and needs to be deleted or no longer used. TTL is used to control and manage the lifetime of online data to ensure that only the most up-to-date, valid information is retained, while old, expired information is discarded.

## Why it is necessary to use TTL to delete expired online data:

1. Memory Management: Minimize memory usage by deleting data that is no longer needed.
2. Security: Ensure that sensitive or important data is not retained for longer than necessary.
3.  Performance optimization: Improve system performance by reducing the load of invalid data.
4. Information Management: Keep the information up-to-date and accurate.

## How TTL works:

TTL is typically set when data is generated or updated. After the TTL period has elapsed, the data is considered expired and will be deleted or ignored in subsequent queries and processing.

## When to use TTL to delete expired online data:

-  Session management: Delete a user's session information after a certain period of time to enhance security.
- Temporary data: Remove temporary or unnecessary data after they have reached the end of their useful life.
- Cache: Manage the cache to ensure that only the latest and valid data is retained.
- Sensitive data: Delete sensitive data after a period of time to meet security and legal requirements.

## Conclusion:

-TTL is an important tool for managing the lifetime of online data. Setting up and using TTL helps ensure that your system always maintains high performance, good security, and effectively manages resources.
# [Email]
## SMTP Server Address:
- SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server address is the address of the server used to send emails. SMTP is the standard protocol for transmitting email over the Internet. The SMTP server acts as an intermediary between the email sending application (such as an email client or webmail service) and the email receiving server.

## What does an SMTP server address include?

1. Hostname: Usually a domain name or IP address of an SMTP server. For example, 'smtp.gmail.com' for the Gmail service.
2. Port: The network port that the SMTP server uses to receive and process email requests. Common ports include:
   - **Port 25**: The default port for SMTP. However, it is often blocked by ISPs to prevent spam.
   - **Port 587**: The port used for secure SMTP connections to STARTTLS.
   - **Port 465**: The port is used for SMTP via SSL/TLS, but is not as popular as Port 587.

## How to configure an SMTP server in an email client (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird):

1. Username: Usually your full email address.
2. Password: The password for your email account.
3. SMTP server: The SMTP server address of the email service you are using.
4. Port: The port corresponds to the security protocol you choose (STARTTLS or SSL/TLS).
5. Authentication Required: Enabled to use a username and password.

## Security Notes:

When configuring an SMTP server, make sure that you use a secure connection (SSL/TLS or STARTTLS) to protect your credentials and email data from potential threats on the network.
## SMTP Server Port:
An SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server port is a network port that an SMTP server uses to receive and process email requests. Each port has a number of different characteristics and uses, especially with regard to security and encryption protocols. Here are some common SMTP ports:

## Common SMTP ports:

1. Port 25:
   - **Description**: This is the default port for SMTP, which is used primarily for forwarding emails between email servers.
   - **Security**: No encryption.
   - **Note**: This port is often blocked by many ISPs to prevent spam, so it is not recommended for sending emails from email clients directly to the email server.
2. Port 587:
   - **Description**: This is the standard gateway for sending emails using SMTP over a secure connection to STARTTLS.
   - **Security**: Use STARTTLS to upgrade the connection from unencrypted to encrypted.
   - **Note**: Recommended for email clients that send emails through SMTP servers.
3. Port 465:
   - **Description**: This port was once used for SMTP over SSL/TLS but has now been replaced by Port 587 with STARTTLS.
   - **Security**: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt the connection from the start.
   - **Note**: Although still supported by some email service providers, this port is no longer as popular and recommended as Port 587.

## How to choose the right SMTP port:

1. Check the email service provider: Each email service provider will have specific instructions on the SMTP port and the security settings to use.
2. Prioritize security: Use port 587 with STARTTLS to ensure the connection is encrypted and secure.
3. Avoid port 25 for email clients: Because they are often blocked by ISPs and are not secure.
 SMTP encoding method:
-SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) encryption method ensures that email data is transmitted securely between the client and the email server. The main encryption methods for SMTP include:

1. STARTTLS
- **Description**: STARTTLS is an encryption method that allows an existing unencrypted connection to be upgraded to encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security) or SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
-**Advantage**:
  - Allows starting with an unencrypted connection and then upgrading to encryption.
  - Supported by most email service providers.
- **How to use**: Use port 587 with STARTTLS encryption.
2. SSL/TLS
- **Description**: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are encryption protocols that ensure that the connection is encrypted from the start. TLS is an improved and more secure version of SSL.
-**Advantage**:
  - The connection is encrypted from the start, ensuring greater security.
  - Often used for SMTP connections that require security from the start.
- **How to use**: Use port 465 with SSL/TLS encryption.

## Compare STARTTLS and SSL/TLS

- STARTTLS:
  - Start with an unencrypted connection and then upgrade to encryption.
  - Use port 587.
  - Popular and recommended for modern email clients.
- SSL/TLS:
  - The connection is encrypted from the start.
  - Use port 465.
  - Less popular than STARTTLS but still supported by many email services.

## Example of SMTP configuration with encryption in an email client

**Configure Gmail with STARTTLS**:
- **SMTP Server**: 'smtp.gmail.com'
- **Gateway**: 587
- **Encryption Method**: STARTTLS
- **Username**: Your full email address (e.g., 'yourname@gmail.com')
- **Password**: Your email password

**Configure Gmail with SSL/TLS**:
- **SMTP Server**: 'smtp.gmail.com'
- **Ports**: 465
- **Encryption Method**: SSL/TLS
- **Username**: Your full email address (e.g., 'yourname@gmail.com')
- **Password**: Your email password

## Reasons to use SMTP encryption

1. Data Security: Protect sensitive information in emails from theft or eavesdropping.
2. Regulatory compliance: Meet legal requirements and regulations on information security.
3.  User Protection: Ensure that personal information and business data are protected when transmitted over the Internet.
## SMTP Accounts:
-An SMTP account is an account that is used to send emails through an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. Every time you send an email from an email client or another application such as email automation, you need to provide the SMTP account information so that the server knows how to process and send the email.

The basic information of an SMTP account includes:

1. Email address: This is your email address, e.g. 'yourname@example.com'.
2. Password: The password of the email account to authenticate the sending of the email.
3. SMTP Server: The SMTP server address that you use to send emails, e.g., 'smtp.example.com'.
4. SMTP Port: The port number that the SMTP server uses to receive email requests, such as port 587 or 465.

-The SMTP account needs to be configured correctly to ensure your app can send emails successfully. Email service providers such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo provide specific information so that you can configure your SMTP account in an email client or an automated email application.
## SMTP Password:
-SMTP password is a password used to authenticate email delivery through an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server. When you configure an SMTP account to send email from an email client or other application, you need to provide this password so that the SMTP server knows that you have permission to send email from your email address.

-SMTP password is usually the password of your email account. To keep this information secure, it is always advisable to ensure that passwords are protected and not shared publicly. When you configure an SMTP account, you enter this password into your application, and the application will use it to authenticate with the SMTP server when sending outgoing emails.
## Mailing Address:
-Sender Address is the email address of the sender of the email message. It is used to identify the sender of the email and is where the recipient of the email will see the sender. The mailing address is usually displayed in the "From" field of the email.

-The mailing address needs to be a valid address and be able to receive emails so that the recipient can reply back if necessary.
## M?u Email:
An email template is a standard design or layout used to send emails during marketing activities, announcements, or communication with customers. Email templates typically include sections such as the subject line, main body, images, link, and email signature. The use of email templates helps ensure consistency in communication and increases the professionalism of the brand.

The key characteristics of email templates include:

1. Subject: The beginning of the email, which introduces the main content of the email.
2. Content: The main part of the email, including specific information or content that the recipient of the email needs to know.
3. Images and graphics: Use to highlight and illustrate the content of the email.
4. Link: The link to the website, article, or product featured in the email.
5. Email Signature: Information about the sender of the email, including name, title, and contact information.

Email templates can be created from email design tools or email marketing services to ensure it fits your purpose and brand.
## Send a test email:
Sending test emails is a process in email marketing and software development, used to test and evaluate emails before they are sent to official recipients. This process helps to ensure that the email will be displayed and perform as expected on different platforms and devices.

The steps to send a test email include:

1. Select a template: Select an email template or create a new email to check.
2. Configuration: Set the configuration parameters such as the sending address, header, body, and image of the email.
3. Send tests: Send test emails to some test users or test email addresses to check factors such as the suitability of content, images, and links.
4. Review and edit: Check the received audit email to determine if the email is displaying correctly and is appropriate. If necessary, edit the content or design to improve efficiency before sending it to the entire recipient list.

-Sending test emails is an important part of the email development process to ensure that your email not only meets aesthetic standards, but also ensures that it will display properly on all platforms and devices that users can use to view the email.
## Enable Report Payments Success notifications:
-"After opening, when the customer pays successfully, a notification email will be sent to the customer" can be understood as the process of automatically sending an email notification to the customer after they have successfully paid for an order or service. 

Typically, an email notification after a successful payment may include the following information:

1. Email subject: For example, "Payment confirmation successful" or "Thank you for payment".
2. Email content: 
   - A thank you from the company or service.
   - Details of the successful checkout transaction, including the amount, order ID (if applicable), and the products/services purchased.
   - Instructions or links to other useful information if any.
   - Contact information if the customer has any questions or support requests.
3. Signature: Usually there will be a signature of the company or relevant department to confirm the legitimacy of the email.

-This helps to ensure that customers receive clear confirmation of their payment and create trust during the purchase or use of the service.

## Robot Token:
-"Robot token" may refer to a token used to authenticate the activities of robots or bots in systems or services. Typically, this token is used to allow bots to perform certain actions without re-authenticating from the user.
## Webhook Setup:
-Setting up a webhook is the process of configuring and connecting a URL to an app or service to receive automated information or notifications from that app when an event occurs. This mechanism allows systems to communicate with each other automatically and in real-time via HTTP.

The main characteristics of webhooks include:

1. Destination URL: This is the URL address to which the webhook will send information or events. This address is usually provided by the application or service that receives the webhook.
